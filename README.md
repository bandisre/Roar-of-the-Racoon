# Roar-of-the-Raccoon
Roar of the Raccoon is a multiplayer game, where one player plays as the Raccoon which is hunting the 'player'. The 'player' is the other non-Raccoon player in the game. The 'player' is trying to escape the abandoned mine shaft they fell into, which houses a mutant raccoon by completing a series of tasks to repair the elevator. Once they repair the elevator, they are free, however in the mean time they must survive/avoid being hunted down by the raccoon player.
# How was it Built?
We built it using Blender, Unity and Photon Network. We used Blender to create the models for the objects needed in tasks as well as the 'player' and raccoon. Unity was used to create the actual game, and Photon Network was used to host the multiplayer server.
# What's next? 
- Implementing more mechanics and tasks -Adding another 'player' character
- Incorporating new voice related mechanics
- Adding more mechanics to the Raccoon player
